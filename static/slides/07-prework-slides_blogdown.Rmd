## Pre-work

This slide deck will lead you through the necessary sections of [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com) to connect RStudio with your GitHub account.

We are going to assume:

‚úÖ Chapter 5: [Register a GitHub account ](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)

‚úÖ Chapter 6: [Install or upgrade R and RStudio](http://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html)

---
## Chapter 7: [Install Git](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)

Key commands in terminal:

```{r eval = FALSE}
which git
git --version
```

---
## Chapter 8: [Introduce yourself to Git](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)

Key commands in terminal:

```{r eval = FALSE}
git config --global user.name 'apreshill'
git config --global user.email 'apresstats@gmail.com'
git config --global --list
```

Obviously change the user name and email to your own.

---
## Skip Chapter 9

---
## Chapter 10: [Connect to GitHub](http://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html)

Do all of this chapter!

---
## Chapter 11: [Cache credentials for HTTPS](http://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html)

Do all of this chapter! (make sure you get through 11.3)

---
## Chapter 12: [Set up keys for SSH](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html)

Optional.

---
## Chapter 13: [Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)

**REQUIRED**: Do all of this chapter!

---
## Chapter 14: [Detect Git from RStudio](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html)

> Note: "This often ‚Äújust works‚Äù, so this page is aimed at people who have reason to suspect they have a problem."

## Hurrah!

You made it this far!

# üéâüéâüéâ

Open up your R project file for your `blogdown` site made in Lab 06.

---
## [Existing project, GitHub last](http://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html)

Now read and do all of this chapter with your `blogdown` site, since we already made the project and want to now connect it to GitHub. See next slide...

Generally, I don't recommend this workflow! IRL I try to do:

- [New project, GitHub first](http://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)

---
## 18.2: [Make or verify a Git repo](http://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html#make-or-verify-a-git-repo)

We'll add GitHub to our existing project, using Chapter 18 from Happy Git with R. Scroll down to (note this is now in your R console, not terminal):

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("usethis")
usethis::use_git()
```

It should say that a restart of RStudio is required, type in "absolutely"

When it restarts, you should see the Git pane in RStudio. Don't forget this step in terminal from your project's working directory:

```{r eval = FALSE}
git init
```

---
# 18.3: [Stage and commit](http://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html#stage-and-commit-1)

Follow instructions to stage and commit.

---
# 18.4: Skip

---
# 18.5: [Make and connect a GitHub repo](http://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html#make-and-connect-a-github-repo-option-2)

As the local repo, use your `blogdown` R project. Now is a great time to edit your `.gitignore` file **before** you push your local repo to a remote. Here is my file for a blogdown site:

```{r eval = FALSE}
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
blogdown
.DS_Store # if a windows user, Thumbs.db instead
public/ # if using Netlify
```

## Great job!
