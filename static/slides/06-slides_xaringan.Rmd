# The name<sup>*</sup>

The R package name `xaringan` was derived from Sharingan, a d≈çjutsu in the Japanese anime Naruto with two abilities:

- the "Eye of Insight"

- the "Eye of Hypnotism"

>"I think a presentation is basically a way to communicate insights to the audience, and a great presentation may even "hypnotize" the audience."~ Yihui Xie (author)

.footnote[
[\*] From Yihui: https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#37.
]
---

# xaringan

- Don't ask me how to pronounce it.

- We'll use it to make slides in R Markdown.

- Install it:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('yihui/xaringan')
```

You don't have to load it to use it.


---

# Let's do this

- File ‚û°Ô∏è New File ‚û°Ô∏è R Markdown ‚û°Ô∏è Click OK

--

- Delete everything but YAML

--

.pull-left[

```{r eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Tada!"
author: "Alison Hill"
date: "May 15, 2018"
output: html_document
---
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Tada!"
author: "Alison Hill"
date: "May 15, 2018"
output: xaringan::moon_reader #<<
---
```
]

--

- Save. (save, save, save!)

---
# Knit to moon reader


- Must mouse over to `Knit` drop-down menu and select "Knit to moon_reader"

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/knit-to-moon-reader.png")
```


---
# Infinite moon reader

- Now mouse up to "Addins" and select `xaringan`: Infinite Moon Reader. 
    - This option does live preview of slides- every time you **SAVE** the Rmd document, the slides will be automatically reloaded in RStudio Viewer.

- From here on, you won't need to knit before using Infinite Moon Reader.

- In RStudio viewer pane, you can `right-click` to select "open frame in new window", or you can open open the file in your browser.

## Using `xaringan`


---
# WT* YAML?

- YAML = YAML Ain't No Markup Language (not helpful)

- aka "R Markdown front-matter"

- You can only have one YAML front-matter for each .Rmd file (multiple YAMLs will confuse moon reader!)

```yaml
---
variable: "value"
---
```

---
# Edit the YAML

I deleted the `date`.

# Slide separators

.pull-left[
- The first slide starts right away. 

- New slides are separated by three dashes in a row `---` on a line by itself (recommend keeping an empty line before)
]

--

.pull-right[
```
# Slide 1
This is slide 1

---
# Slide 2
This is slide 2
```
]

---
# Know your markdown 

https://www.markdowntutorial.com

--

You can use markdown to do [links](https://www.markdowntutorial.com), *italics*, and **bold**. 

--

.pull-left[
You can also:

- do
- bullets
- plus
  - nested
- lists
  - if you like
]

--

.pull-right[
```
1. or
1. numbered
1. lists
1. too
```

# Pro-tip!

In RStudio, mouse over to Help ‚û°Ô∏è Markdown Quick Reference!


![](../images/markdown-quick-reference.png)

---
# Align your slides

Use the [`class` property](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Markdown#class) on the line immediately after the slide break:

- `class:`
    - `inverse`
    - `center` 
    - `left` (default)
    - `right` 
    - `middle` (vertically)
    - `bottom` 
    - `top` (default)

--

You can combine any of these using commas to separate. All my blue background slides are created with:

```
---
class: inverse, middle, center
```

---
# Title your slides
## This font is smaller


Slide titles and text follow Markdown formatting:
- A big title uses `#`
- But you can also use `##`

--

Try creating a new slide that uses 2 or more classes and has a big title!

```
---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Title your slides
## This font is smaller
```

---
# Two column slides

Another nice built-in CSS feature is `.pull-left[ ]` and `.pull-right[ ]`

Try this:
```
.pull-left[
on your left
]

.pull-right[
on your right
]
```
--

You should see:

.pull-left[
on your left
]

.pull-right[
on your right
]

---
# Make an incremental slide

One of my favorite things about `xaringan` is the ability to make any slide, anywhere, incremental. To do this, use `--` (that is right, two dashes on a line alone- not three which is a slide break!)

```

## Do this with a two column slide!

.pull-left[

.pull-right[

---
# Full image slides

Use the [`background-image` property](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Markdown#background-image) right after slide break (`---`):

- `background-image: url("actual url or file path here")`
- `background-size: cover` --> image is scaled to fit into the slide.
- `background-position:` play with [this](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.asp)

--

Try this in a new slide:

```
---
background-image: url("http://bit.ly/cs631-donkey")
background-size: cover
```

---
class: inverse
background-image: url("http://bit.ly/cs631-donkey")
background-size: cover



---
# Adding images to slides

Use an R chunk (we haven't even done R yet!)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("http://bit.ly/cs631-pygmy")
```



---
# Adding images to slides

Set the chunk option to `{r echo = FALSE}` to just show the image:

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://bit.ly/cs631-pygmy")
```

---
## Use images in an incremental two column slide!

.pull-left[

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://bit.ly/cs631-pygmy")
```

]

--

.pull-right[

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://bit.ly/cs631-sheep")
```
]

---
# Local images

`xaringan` requires that all local image file paths are *relative*. 

What does that mean? 

It means you cannot use `here` within a call to `knitr::include_graphics`.
- It will work locally, but not if you are pushing to GitHub for example.

--

2 options:

- Use markdown: `![](path/to/my/image.jpg)` (no quotes, and in plain text of Rmd!)

--

- Or (path in quotes now, and within an R code chunk!):

```{r eval = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("path/to/my/image.jpg")
```


---
## Local image file paths

- This image now is saved in a subfolder of my *current* "slides" working directory.

--

- *If* I could use `here`, this is the file path: `here("slides", "images", "sheep.jpg")`

--

```{r out.width = '50%'}
include_graphics("images/sheep.jpg")
```

---
## Going up a level

- Use `../` to go to a folder one level up from the current folder

--

- This image now is saved in a subfolder of my *current* "project" working directory, which is a level ‚¨ÜÔ∏è from my "slides" folder.

--

- *If* I could use `here`, this is the file path: `here("images", "sheep.jpg")`

--


```{r out.width = '50%'}
include_graphics("../images/sheep.jpg")
```


---
# Now for some R!

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(babynames)
library(tidyverse)
alison <- babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Alison" | name == "Allison") %>% 
  filter(sex == "F") 
ggplot(alison, aes(x = year, 
                           y = prop,  
                           group = name, 
                           color = name)) + 
  geom_line()  
```

---
# Control your R

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=10.5, fig.height=4}
library(babynames)
library(tidyverse)
alison <- babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Alison" | name == "Allison") %>% 
  filter(sex == "F") 
ggplot(alison, aes(x = year, 
                           y = prop,  
                           group = name, 
                           color = name)) + 
  geom_line()  
```

Use in your code chunks:
- `fig.width=` (here I did 10.5)
- `fig.height=` (here I did 4)



---
# Control all of your R

You can do this for all code chunks in your **global chunk options**: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, 
                      fig.width = 10.5, fig.height = 4, 
                      comment = NA, rows.print = 16)
```

---
# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```



---
# Play with CSS in YAML

## Local image file paths- try2
