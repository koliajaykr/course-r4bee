## So what is blogdown?<sup>*</sup>


- [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) <img src="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RStudio_Hex_rmarkdown.png" width="10%" align="right" />

    - (relatively) simple syntax for writing documents
    
    - the simpler, the more portable (multiple output formats)
    
    - not only convenient (maintenance), but also reproducible
    
    - most features of R Markdown _and_ [**bookdown**](https://bookdown.org) (technical writing)!!

--

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) <img src="https://gohugo.io/img/hugo.png" width="10%" align="right" />

    - free, open-source, and easy to install (a single binary)
    
    - lightning fast (generates one page in one millisecond)
    
    - general-purpose (not only for blogs)

???

Pandoc's Markdown: paragraphs, section headings, (un)numbered lists, blockquotes, math expressions, tables, images, footnotes, bibliography/citations, ...

See Chapter 2 of the **bookdown** book for additional Markdown features, such as figure/table captions, cross-references, numbered equations, theorems, ...


---

## Why not WordPress, Tumblr, Medium.com, Blogger.com, etc?<sup>*</sup>

- No R Markdown support (even math support is often nonexistent or awkward)

--

- Huge benefits of static websites compared to dynamic websites

    - all static files, no PHP or databases, no login/password, work everywhere (even offline)
    
    - typically fast to visit (no computation needed on the server side), and easy to speed up via CDN

If all you want to write about is what you had for breakfast today, or how cute your kittens are, there is no need to use blogdown. If there is anything related to R, statistical computing, and/or graphics, blogdown will be much more convenient.

# Overriding vs editing

https://gohugo.io/themes/customizing/

> *When you use a theme cloned from its git repository, do not edit the theme’s files directly. Instead, theme customization in Hugo is a matter of overriding the templates made available to you in a theme. This provides the added flexibility of tweaking a theme to meet your needs while staying current with a theme’s upstream.*

# Update logo

Mouse over the `static/img/` and see `logo.png`? We can replace that file, or make new file. I'll replace mine with [this picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace).

```{r eval = FALSE}

---
# Success?


```{r echo = FALSE}

# Edit content 

Mouse to `content/` and:

- Edit your `about.md`
  - [Awesome slide deck here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pt8eXaGkFH8JTfOjcyvqt1n6DsUs5bSMuHy_NxepMfQ/edit#slide=id.p4)
  - Example 1: [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/about/)
  - Example 2: [Kara Woo](https://karawoo.com)
  - Example 3 (a bit longer): [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/about/)
  - Example 4: [Emily Robinson](http://hookedondata.org/about/)
  - Example 5: [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/about/)
  - Example 6: [Chester Ismay](http://chester.rbind.io/about/)

--

- Edit your `home.md`
  - We'll make this your new landing page, so imagine this is what people will initially see when they visit your site.
      - Example 1: [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz)
      - Example 2: [Sam Tyner](https://sctyner.github.io)

# Success?


```{r echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("../images/about-ada.png")
```

---
class: inverse, middle, center



# 🏇

## Now we override!

---
# Let's override the home page

- Index is default landing page for Hugo

--

- Look in your theme's layouts directory (`/themes/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme/layouts`).
  - Open `index.html`- this is the layout for your current home page.

--

- Make a *copy* of this file.

--

- Put the *copy* in the analogous project root directory: `/layouts/`
  - It *must* be named `index.html`

---
# Edit the `index.html` *copy*

- Edit the version in `/layouts/`
  - *not* `/themes/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme/layouts`
  
--

- We'll remove the latest posts and best posts sections:

--

```
{{ partial "header.html" . }}
<div class="main column">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content">
            {{ range where .Data.Pages "Title" "Home" }}
                <div class="markdown">
                {{ .Content }}
                </div>
            {{ end }}
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{{ partial "footer.html" . }}
```

---
# Success?


```{r echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("../images/ada-home.png")
```

---
# Workflow<sup>*</sup>


- Open your website project, click the "Serve Site" addin
    
- Revise old pages/posts, or click the "New Post" addin
    
- Write and save (take a look at the automatic preview)
    
- Push everything to Github

## What is hard about `blogdown`?

- A lot!
- TOML in `config` file, but YAML in posts
- Themes vary a lot
- Overriding versus editing directory structure
- Related to ⬆️, you have to learn Hugo (in addition to `blogdown`)
- For much customization, you'll also have to be comfortable with [CSS](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/css.html)
- [File paths!](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2018/02/27/r-file-paths/)
