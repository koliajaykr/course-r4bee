Hello, you all are welcomed to the session of topic number 2 which is data wrangling. In this session you will learn:

-   how to import/export data
-   to perform data manipulation for data observations
-   to perform data manipulation for data variables
-   to calculate summary statistics for the variables

Data wrangling is focused upon the "data exploration and data manipulation" [(Jesse Mostipak)](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/dive-into-dplyr-tutorial-1). As per [Hadley & Garrett](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) "together tidy and transforming" are called wrangling. Tidy data means that your data should be stored as each row represents an unique observation and each column represents an unique variable. By data data transformation means "narrowing in on observations of interest ... creating new variables that are functions of existing variables ... and calculating a set of summary statistics."

# Data - Palmer Penguins

data with 344 rows (sample/observations) and 8 variables (columns):

`species` : a factor denoting penguin species (Ad√©lie, Chinstrap and Gentoo)

`island` : a factor denoting island in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica (Biscoe, Dream or Torgersen)

`bill_length_mm` : a number denoting bill length (millimeters)

`bill_depth_mm` : a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)

`flipper_length_mm` :  an integer denoting flipper length (millimeters)

`body_mass_g` : an integer denoting body mass (grams)

`sex` : a factor denoting penguin sex (female, male)

`year` : an integer denoting the study year (2007, 2008, or 2009)

## Import data

```{r}
library(readr)
penguins <- read_csv("data/penguins.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    species = col_factor(),
    island = col_factor(),
    bill_length_mm = col_double(),
    bill_depth_mm = col_double(),
    flipper_length_mm = col_integer(),
    body_mass_g = col_integer(),
    sex = col_factor(),
    year = col_integer()
  )
)
```

Types of the variables:

-   `int` stands for integers.

-   `dbl` stands for doubles, or real numbers.

-   `chr` stands for character vectors, or strings.

-   `dttm` stands for date-times (a date + a time).

-   `lgl` stands for logical, vectors that contain only TRUE or FALSE.

-   `fct` stands for factors, which R uses to represent categorical variables with fixed possible values.

-   `date` stands for dates.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

glimpse(penguins)
```

## Data summary

It is also a good idea to summarise the data.

### using the skim function

```{r}
library(skimr)

skimr::skim(penguins)
```

you should also try the functions `str()` and `dim()`.

# `dplyr` package for data manipulation

```{r}
# use tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# or just use dplyr
# library(dplyr)
```

**tidyverse** is a set of these packages:

-   `ggplot2`, for data visualisation.

-   `dplyr`, for data manipulation.

-   `tidyr`, for data tidying.

-   `readr`, for data import.

-   `purrr`, for functional programming.

-   `tibble`, for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames.

-   `stringr`, for strings.

-   `forcats`, for factors.

Five key functions from **dplyr** package:

1.  Pick observations by their values using function `filter()`.

2.  Reorder the rows using function `arrange()`.

3.  Pick variables by their names using function `select()`.

4.  Create new variables with functions of existing variables using function `mutate()`.

5.  Collapse many values down to a single summary using function `summarise()`.

as this [site](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html) explains these functions can be categories based upon:

-   Rows:

    -   `filter()` chooses rows based on column values.
    -   `slice()` chooses rows based on location.
    -   `arrange()` changes the order of the rows.

-   Columns:

    -   `select()` changes whether or not a column is included.
    -   `rename()` changes the name of columns.
    -   `mutate()` changes the values of columns and creates new columns.
    -   `relocate()` changes the order of the columns.

-   Groups of rows:

    -   `summarise()` collapses a group into a single row.

You may have noticed that the syntax and function of all these verbs are very similar:

-   The first argument is a data frame.

-   The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame. You can refer to columns in the data frame directly without using \$.

-   The result is a new data frame

## Pipes

`%>%` this is called pipe. It comes from the r package **magrittr**.

-   "allow you to express a sequence of multiple operations"

> [I]t focuses on verbs, not nouns. by Hadley

-   "you don't assign anything within the pipes"

-   "Remember to add the pipe `%>%` at the end of each line involved in the piped operation"

# Based upon rows

## Based upon a factor variable

I need data only about the female penguins.

```{r}
filter(
  penguins,
  sex == "female"
)
```

-   using the magrittr pipes `%>%`

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(sex == "female")
```

## Based upon a numeric variable

Instead of a factor variable, you can also try to filter the rows/samples based upon a numeric value as well.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(bill_length_mm < 40)
```

## Based upon a factor and a numeric variable

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(
    sex == "male",
    bill_length_mm > 35,
    body_mass_g > 1000
  )
```

# Based upon columns

## Based upon the place of variable

from variable first to the third variable

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(1:3)
```

all variable except variables from first to the third variables

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(-c(1:3))
```

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(c(1, 4, 5, 6, 8))
```

## Based upon exact name of the column

you can always replace the digit place of the variables with the exact name of the variables

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(-c(sex, species, year, island))
```

# Arrange the data

```{r}
penguins %>%
  arrange(bill_length_mm)
```

you can also decide the ascending or the descending order of the variable

```{r}
penguins %>%
  arrange(desc(bill_length_mm))
```

# Mutate the data

```{r}
penguins %>%
  mutate(mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000)
```

to show the last hidden columns lets call only the last four columns

```{r}
penguins %>%
  mutate(mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000) %>%
  select(4:9)
```

another way is to remove all variables and keep only the newly calculated variable

```{r}
penguins %>%
  transmute(mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000)
```

# Based upon group of rows

```{r}
penguins %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarise(mean(bill_length_mm))
```

# Rename the variables

let's rename the variable `bill_length_mm` as just `length`

```{r}
penguins %>%
  rename(length = bill_length_mm)
```

we can also select to show only the newly renamed variable as well

```{r}
penguins %>%
  rename(length = bill_length_mm) %>%
  select(length)
```

also you can rename several together

```{r highlight=TRUE}
penguins %>%
  rename(
    length = bill_length_mm,
    depth = bill_depth_mm,
    weight = body_mass_g
  )
```
