Hi there :) 

I teach data science using R statistical language to underprivileged students in India without any tuition fee. Thank you for visiting my website. I'm a PhD survivor & an MBA Gold Medallist in tourism studies. I love to teach data science using R statistical language. 

If you are taking your first step toward data science and feeling scared then this course is for you. No recorded videos. There will be live interactive sessions at the [Nalanda Academy](https://nalanda-academy.org/) - Wardha.  

To join this course kindly fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/CN4guCNgnzLGACgW9). Please contact me if you have any queries. I'll be happy to reply to your emails and Twitter DMs.

P.S. 

- Thank you so much Vineeta for zillion invaluable inputs and Neha for contributing awesome bee artworks.

- *Why bee?* Bee sounds cool with beginners. Also, the shape of R packages is similar to honeycomb. And moreover, to support the cause "save the bees".
