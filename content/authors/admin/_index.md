Hello,

In this course, you will learn data science using R from scratch. It is equally good for students and professionals. Purpose of this course is to build your confidence by introducing the basics of R, R markdown, visualisations, data wrangling, tables and slides. 

Right now lectures and practice sessions are combined. In one batch maximum thirty students will be registered. This increases interaction and focuses upon the learning of each participant. 

English will be used as the medium of instruction. I can teach in Hindi as well if required.

Why bee? Bee rhymes with the word beginner. The shape of R packages is like a hexagonal honeycomb. Moreover, to support the cause “save the bees”. 

If you’ve any course related query or a teaching opportunity for me then I’ll be very happy 🙂 to read your email.
