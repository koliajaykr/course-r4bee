Hi there :) 

My name is Ajay. I teach this course. 

I'm a PhD survivor with MBA in tourism studies. I love to teach data science using R statistical language. 

If you are afraid but still want to take your first step towards data science then this course is for you.

No recorded videos. There will be live interactive sessions using Google Meet. 

To join this course kindly fill this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/CN4guCNgnzLGACgW9). Please contact me if you have any queries. I'll be happy to reply to your emails and Twitter DMs.
